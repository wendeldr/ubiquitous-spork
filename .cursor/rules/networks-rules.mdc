# Your rule content

- If running python always use conda environment networks (conda activate networks) but only for python
- Before correcting or changing anything automatically generate a new github commit and fill it out with current canges and planned changes/what is being addressed. Keep it summarized and succinct.
- If trying to insert/update a *.ipynb file just return the python code for me to paste and do not run anything. Do not return jupyter code
